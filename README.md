# Horse-racing-finishtime-Predication
Horse racing finishtime predition using different types machine learning models
This project begins with a comprehensive data understanding and preprocessing phase. I started by exploring the dataset in detail, identifying important features, and handling missing values and outliers. Proper data cleaning techniques such as imputation, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling were applied to ensure the dataset was ready for modeling.

Following preprocessing, I focused on building predictive models using regression-based approaches. Initially, I trained a Linear Regression model, ensuring that it aligned with key regression assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, multicollinearity, and normality of residuals). To improve performance and capture non-linearity, I experimented with multiple models including:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Each model was evaluated based on performance metrics like RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This comparative analysis helped identify the best-performing algorithm for the dataset, offering valuable insights into which model generalized better on unseen data.
